# JIRA To Omnifocus (Legacy)

The original blog post for this is [here](http://www.hackerdude.com/2009/03/04/jira-to-omnifocus-script/)

__Please note that Ruby 1.8.7 is required!  At the present moment the rb-appscript gem does NOT work
on Ruby 1.9.2.__

This script logs into your JIRA and creates OmniFocus tasks for each of the JIRA items that are
assigned to you, so they sync to your Omnifocus for iPhone, you only have to keep track of one
inbox, etc. It only takes a tiny bit of setup.
